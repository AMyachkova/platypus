    "\n",
    "One of the most effective ways to learn is to engage actively with the content of interest. By working through some of these problems, you will have the opportunity to\n",

    "2. receive feedback so that you can make corrections to your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use these practice problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems generally increase in difficulty going further down, testing increasingly sophisticated skills. The section titles give an idea of what skill the problems intend to improve. If the problems in a given section are too easy, don't hesitate to skip them and take note that you have mastered the corresponding skill. If a problem is too challenging, try to figure out what makes the problem challenging and go back to earlier problems if necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "When hints and answers are provided, try your best to **complete as much of the problem as you can first, then look at the hints and answers** when stuck or to check your work. Sometimes the answers will have further explanation and commentary, which will hopefully add perspective to the problem. Don't worry if you don't understand all of the explanation, or if you did the problem a different way. Hopefully, the hints and answers will add some interactivity to the problems and allow you to reflect on the material.\n",

    "The problems here complements the quantum information material discussed in John Watrous' [Single Systems lesson](https://learn.qiskit.org/course/basics/single-systems). The assumed background is a facility with linear algebra, and later problems also ask for mathematical arguments, i.e., proofs. Feel free to try out the problems below and decide whether they are a good fit for you. \n",

    "1. Decide whether or not a given mathematical object can represent a quantum state or quantum operation.\n",
    "2. Read and express probabilistic states and operations in both matrix and Dirac representations.\n",
    "3. Convert between matrix and Dirac representations of operators.\n",
    "4. Understand the essential definitions which occur frequently in quantum information science.\n",
    "5. Reason about general properties of state vectors and unitary operations.\n",

    "You and your friend Rosemary are working on a quantum computing task and need to verify whether a certain matrix $A$ is unitary. Rosemary is feeling short on time and is frustrated by the fact that $A$ must preserve the Euclidean norm for every vector. She has an idea to speed things up.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It is obviously impossible to check that $A$ keeps the length of every single vector the same. The number of distinct vectors is infinite. Thankfully, $A$ is linear! Therefore, we only need to check things for an orthonormal basis. We might as well choose the standard basis since it’s easiest. By linearity, if $A$ keeps the length of standard basis vectors constant, $A$ will keep the length of every vector the same, and we’re done!”\n",
