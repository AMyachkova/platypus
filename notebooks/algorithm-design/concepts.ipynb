    "All physical systems, whether classical or quantum, can exist in different states. For example, a car on a road can have a certain mass, position, speed, or acceleration that characterize its state. Similarly, quantum systems can also have different configurations or states, but they differ from classical systems in how we deal with measurements and state evolution. This leads to unique properties such as *superposition* and *entanglement* that are exclusive to quantum mechanics."

    "### Quantum states and measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we can describe a car's state using physical properties like speed or acceleration, we can also describe the state of a quantum system using *observables*, which are mathematical objects.\n",
    "In quantum mechanics, states are represented by normalized complex column vectors, or *kets* ($|\\psi\\rangle$), and observables are hermitian linear operators ($\\hat{H}=\\hat{H}^{\\dagger}$) that act on the kets. Measuring an observable for one of its *eigenstates* ($|\\lambda\\rangle$, i.e. eigenvectors) will give us the corresponding eigenvalue ($\\lambda$) as readout.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key difference between quantum and classical mechanics is that quantum states do not need to be eigenstates, instead they can be expressed as a linear combination, or *superposition*, of the orthonormal basis of eigenstates of any given observable. Measuring a superposition state gives us a random sample of the eigenvalues, with the probability of each outcome determined by the coefficients of the corresponding eigenstates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the probability of obtaining a specific eigenvalue $\\lambda$ when the state is $|\\psi\\rangle$ would be the module square of the coefficient of the corresponding eigenstate $|\\lambda\\rangle$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$. These coefficients can be obtained by computing the scalar product of $|\\psi\\rangle$ and the eigenstate $|\\lambda\\rangle$, $\\langle \\lambda| \\psi \\rangle$, where $\\langle \\lambda|=|\\lambda\\rangle^\\dagger$ is a row vector or *bra*, so the probability of obtaining $\\lambda$ is $p_{\\lambda} = |\\langle \\lambda| \\psi \\rangle|^2$. This probability can be equivalently interpreted as the probability that the state is $|\\lambda\\rangle$. As a reminder, this [uncertainty is fundamental](gloss:uncertainty).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all hermitian operators share the same eigenvectors, which means that the observables they represent cannot be measured simultaneously. This gives rise to the uncertainty principle, which is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, quantum states can be described by observables, and measuring observables gives us information about the state. Superposition states are a key feature of quantum mechanics, and the uncertainty principle arises from the fact that not all observables can be measured simultaneously."

    "### State evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to change a quantum state from $|\\psi\\rangle$ to another state $|\\phi\\rangle$, we use a unitary operator $U$ that represents that change. This change is described with the follow expression, $U|\\psi\\rangle = |\\phi\\rangle$, where $U^\\dagger = U^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has important implications for quantum mechanics, including the fact that information is always preserved and orthogonal states remain orthogonal. For quantum computing, ideal quantum gates represent unitary operations on the underlying state. However, noise can make these operations non-unitary, which means that we lose information. For simplicity, we won't discuss these cases in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "One exception to the rule of gates being unitary is *measurement gates*, which take a random sample of a particular observable and destroy information about the complete probability distribution. The system is then left in the eigenstate associated with the measured value."

    "### Quantum computing\n",

    "Quantum computing is based on the concept of \"qubits,\" which are quantum systems that can only be in two different states, labeled $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. These represent the minimum unit of quantum information, analogous to the classical bits `0` and `1`. For an $n$-qubit system, there are $2^n$ possible independent states, each labeled by an $n$-bit string, just like a classical system composed of multiple bits. The set of these $n$-bit strings is called the *computational basis*, and circuit readouts (i.e., measurement outputs) are generally expressed in terms of this basis. For example, if we have a 2-qubit system, the computational basis is $\\{|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle, |10\\rangle, |11\\rangle\\}$, and measurement outputs may be expressed as binary strings like $\\{\\texttt{00}, \\texttt{01}, \\texttt{10}, \\texttt{11}\\}$."
