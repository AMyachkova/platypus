    "### What is the purpose of these problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most effective ways to learn is to engage actively with the content of interest. By working through some of these problems, you will have the opportunity to\n",
    "\n",
    "1. hone your skills and knowledge, and\n",
    "1. receive feedback so that you can make corrections to your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will you learn by doing these problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing the exercises in the following sections will, over time and repetition, develop your expertise in the analysis of quantum systems, including transforming and measuring systems. The tools and techniques you learn here will underlie much of the field of quantum information. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use these practice problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems generally increase in difficulty going further down, testing increasingly sophisticated skills. The section titles give an idea of what skill the problems intend to improve. If the problems in a given section are too easy for you, **don't hesitate to skip them** and take note that you have mastered the corresponding skill. If a problem is too challenging, try to figure out what makes the problem challenging and **go back to earlier problems** if necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "When hints and answers are provided, try your best to **complete as much of the problem as you can first**, then look at the hints and answers when stuck or to check your work. Sometimes the answers will have further explanation and commentary, which may add perspective to the problem. Don't worry if you don't understand all of the explanation, or if you did the problem a different way. The hints and answers add interactivity to the problems and allow you to reflect on the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the assumed background for these problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems here complement the quantum information material discussed in the [Single Systems lesson](https://learn.qiskit.org/course/basics/single-systems) of the [Understanding Quantum Information and Computation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Av89fZenSY) course. The assumed background is a facility with linear algebra, and later problems also ask for mathematical arguments, i.e., proofs. You will also benefit from doing the previous problem set for classical information, though this is not strictly necessary. Feel free to try out the problems and decide whether they are a good fit for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decide whether or not a given mathematical object can represent a quantum state or quantum operation.\n",
    "2. Read and express quantum states and operations in both matrix and Dirac representations.\n",
    "3. Convert between matrix and Dirac representations of linear transformations.\n",
    "4. Understand the essential definitions which occur frequently in quantum information.\n",
    "5. Reason about general properties of state vectors and unitary operations.\n",
    "6. Recognize the parallels in the mathematics of classical and quantum systems."
