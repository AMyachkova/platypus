    "By convention, the starting state of an $n$-qubit quantum circuit is the _default state_ $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$. However, it can be more convenient in some cases to start your variational algorithm from a different state. For example, if you have an educated guess of the solution, the variational algorithm will likely converge faster if you start with that state. We will refer to this \"starting\" state as the _reference state_ $|\\rho\\rangle$.\n",

Nonetheless, this does not mean that we have a _parametrized reference state_ which is **forbidden** by definition (i.e. reference states must be actual states). Instead, each value of the parameter $\\alpha$ represents a different reference state, and therefore a \"different\" variational workload; so this should be regarded only as a convenient way to write a set of _workload configurations_. \n",

    "Generally speaking, the reference parameters $\\vec{\\alpha}$ are always fixed for a given payload, and therefore remain separate from the variational parameters which will be included through a [_variational form_](ansatz.ipynb).

Even though a set of different reference operators $\\{U_{R1}, U_{R2},..., U_{RN}\\}$ might be expressed as $\\{U_R(\\vec{\\alpha})$ for $\\vec{\\alpha} \\in \\{\\vec{\\alpha}_1,\\vec{\\alpha}_2,...,\\vec{\\alpha}_N\\}\\} = \\{U_R(\\vec{\\alpha}_1),U_R(\\vec{\\alpha}_2),...,U_R(\\vec{\\alpha}_N)\\}$, and $U_R(\\vec{\\alpha})$ in turn as a parameterized quantum circuit, it does not mean that the reference state is parametrized —for those parameters will always be fixed throughout the algorithm run."
