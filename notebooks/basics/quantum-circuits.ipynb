    "You likely already have some familiarity with *electrical* circuits, whether replacing a blown fuse or charging the device used to read this text. Electrical circuits have *wires* which allow for the flow of electricity, as well as various *components* like batteries or transistors, which manipulate the flow of electricity as it passes through. \n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, *circuits* are models of computation that are loosely based on the real-life picture of electrical circuits. Instead of electricity, *information* is carried by wires through a network of *gates*, analogous to electrical components . Gates are operations that transform the information carried by the wires. By passing wires through a suitable arrangement of gates, one can construct an enormous variety of transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have seen or heard about quantum circuits even prior to this course. Quantum circuits are just one example of a model of computation based on this more general concept. For example, one can construct circuits for manipulating *classical* information as well, and indeed this forms the basis for much of conventional computation.\n",

    "Although the word \"circuit\" often refers to a circular path, circular paths aren't actually allowed in the most common circuit models of computation.\n",
    "That is to say, we usually study *acyclic circuits* when we're thinking about circuits as computational models. A definite *input* is specified at the beginning of the circuit, and a unique *output* is produced on the other end. \n",
    "Quantum circuits follow this pattern; although we could run a quantum circuit as many times as we like, a quantum circuit itself represents a finite sequence of operations that cannot contain feedback loops."

    "### 1.1 Boolean circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate these ideas, let's begin with a simple example. A *Boolean circuit* is one in which the output is a single classical bit (though the input could be many bits). Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example of a Boolean circuit](images/quantum-circuits/Boolean-circuit-XOR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The wires, represented by lines, carry binary values, i.e., bits of information. The gates, represented by labelled squares, are *Boolean logic operations*. These are operations which, given one or more input wires, output a single wire. As with circuits, the designation \"Boolean\" indicates a single binary output, but more general logic operations, with multiple output wires, are also possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The flow of information along the wires goes from left to right. The wires on the leftmost side of the figure, labeled $\\mathsf{X}$ and $\\mathsf{Y}$, are the input bits, which can each be set to whatever binary value we choose. The wire on the right-hand side is the output, which is completely determined by the input and cannot be specified separately. Traveling along any wire, the value (0 or 1) stays the same, only changing when passing through a gate. Wherever two wires intersect, we use a filled-in dot to denote the wires being *connected*. If two wires cross with no dot, then the wires simply pass over one another, not affecting each other in any way. Other conventions exist, and sometimes a gap or a small loop is used to indicate unconnected crossing wires.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alternate notation disconnected wires](images/quantum-circuits/unconnected-wires.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For consistency, any connected wires must have the same binary value. It is interesting to note that, in the context of electrical circuits, having two wires with different \"values\" (voltages) can cause overheating and melting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three types of gates shown in the circuit above are the AND ($\\wedge$), OR ($\\vee$), and NOT ($\\neg$) gates.\n",
    "The functions computed by these gates matches what is expected from their colloquial meaning, and will likely be familiar to many readers. But here they are, represented by a tables of values or \"truth table\":\n",

See if you can understand the other rows of the tables above using this reasoning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two small circles on the wires just to the right of the names $\\mathsf{X}$ and $\\mathsf{Y}$ represent *fanout* operations, which simply creates multple copies of a wire with the same value as the input.\n",
    "Fanout operations are not always considered to be gates in the classical setting — sometimes they are treated as if they are \"free\" in some sense — but when we discuss how ordinary Boolean circuits can be converted into equivalent quantum circuits, we must classify fanout operations explicitly as gates to account for them correctly.\n",

    "It may not seem clear, at first, what these properties have to do with the pictorial notion of projection. The second condition says, essentially, that after one projection, subsequent projections have no effect. The image is \"already on the screen\". The first condition ensures that any vectors perpendicular to the projection plane (or line, or general subspace) are mapped to zero. Thinking about shadows on a paper, this is like fixing the light \"directly overhead\" instead of at an angle. Interestingly, it turns out that these two conditions alone completely capture the notion of a projection. \n",

    "The second remark is that the no-cloning theorem is a statement about the impossibility of cloning an *arbitrary* state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$.\n",
    "We can easily create a clone of any standard basis state, for instance. More generally, any orthonormal basis can be perfectly cloned.\n",

    "\n",
    "One final remark about the no-cloning theorem is that it really isn't unique to quantum information, it's also impossible to clone an arbitrary probabilistic state using a classical (deterministic or probabilistic) process.\n",
    "This is pretty intuitive.\n",
    "Imagine someone hands you a system in some probabilistic state, but you're not sure what that probabilistic state is.\n",
    "For example, maybe they randomly generated a number between $1$ and $10$, but they didn't tell you how they generated that number.\n",
    "There's certainly no physical process through which you can obtain two *independent* copies of that same probabilistic state: all you have in your hands is a number between $1$ and $10$, and there just isn't enough information present for you to somehow reconstruct the probabilities for all of the other outcomes to appear.\n",
    "Mathematically speaking, a version of the no-cloning theorem for probabilistic states can be proved in exactly the same way as the regular no-cloning theorem (for quantum states).\n",
