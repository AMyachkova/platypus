An $n$-qubit system (i.e. _Hilbert space_) has a vast amount of distinct quantum states in the configuration space. We would require an unwieldy large number of parameters to fully explore it. Quantitatively, its dimensionality is $D = 2^{2n}$. To make matters worse, the runtime complexity of search algorithms —and others alike— grows exponentially with this dimensionality, a phenomenon often referred to in the literature as the _curse of dimensionality_.\n",

    "One of the most widely used examples of heuristic ansatze are the [N-local circuits](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit_library.html#n-local-circuits), due to a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient implementation**: The N-local ansatz is typically composed of simple, local gates that can be implemented efficiently on a quantum computer, using a small number of physical qubits. This makes it easier to construct and optimize quantum circuits.\n",
    "- **Captures important correlations**: The N-local ansatz can capture important correlations between the qubits in a quantum system, even with a small number of gates. This is because the local gates can act on neighboring qubits and create entanglement between them, which can be important for simulating complex quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "These circuits consist of rotation and entanglement layers that are repeated alternatively one or more times as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each layer is formed by gates of size at most $N$, where $N$ has to be lower than the number of qubits.\n",
    "- For a rotation layer, the gates are stacked on top of each other. We can use standard rotation operations, such as [`RX`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.RXGate.html) or [`CRZ`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.CRZGate.html)\n",
    "- For an entanglement layer, we can use gates like [`Toffoli` gates](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.CCXGate.html) or [`CX`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate.html#qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate) with an entanglement strategy.\n",
    "- Both types of layers can be parameterized or not, but at least one of them needs to contain parameters. Otherwise, without at least one parameter, there wouldn't be any *variations*!\n",
    "- Optionally, an extra rotation layer is added to the end of the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's create a $5$-qubit [`NLocal`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.NLocal.html) circuit with rotation blocks formed by [`RX`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.RXGate.html) and [`CRZ`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.CRZGate.html) gates, entanglement blocks formed by [`Toffoli` gates](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.CCXGate.html) that act on qubits $[0,1,2]$, $[0,2,3]$, $[4,2,1]$ and $[3,1,0]$ and $2$ repetitions of each layer."
